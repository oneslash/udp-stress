# ðŸŽ¢ UDP Stress tester

I have created a quick CLI tool to send file content from the `files` directory and sends randomly content of files from the folder.

I created it to test my project, feel free to use and send PRs.



## How to install:

```bash
$ cargo install udp-stress
```

## How to use:

```bash
$ udp-stress <ADDR:PORT> <FOLDER>
```

**folder** - param will be defaulted to the `<BIN_WORKDIR>/files`
